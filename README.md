# XGBoost_OD_TBBE

This repository contains the code used in the dissertation "Implementation of Iterative XGBoost Agents Within an In-Play
Betting Exchange Simulator". The code is used to train and test iterative XGBoost models using data collected from the Bristol Betting Exchange (BBE) platform.

The model training and statistical testing code is in the `XGBoost_ModelTraining` folder and the simulator code is in the `XGBoost_TBBE` folder. Both folders contain a `README.md` file with more details on the execution of the code.
